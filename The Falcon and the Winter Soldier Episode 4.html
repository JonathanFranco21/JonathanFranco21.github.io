Flashbacks from <a href="Captain America The Winter Soldier.html"/>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a> and <a href="Captain America Civil War.html"/>Captain America: Civil War</a> are shown.</li>
        <li>In the present, Ayo reminds Bucky of Zemo being responsible for King T'Chaka's death during the UN Summit Meeting from <a href="Captain America Civil War.html"/>Captain America: Civil War</a> and framing Bucky.</li> 
        <li>Sam finds out about the bombing from <a href="The Falcon and the Winter Soldier Episode 3.html"/>Episode 3</a> leaving 3 dead and 11 injured.</li>
        <li>Bucky feels threatened by Zemo's choice of words and throws down the cup.</li>
        <li>Discussions about how Karli wants to start a revolution to kill those who stayed during the Snap in <a href="Avengers Infinity War.html"/>Avengers: Infinity War</a>, even if they're innocent people.</li>
        <li>John gets impatient and uses a surprise attack on Karli while Sam tries to convince her to stop the attacks, in which gets into a chase between Bucky and Karli, with Karli getting shot a few times by Zemo and destorying most of the Super Soldier serum vials, before getting knocked out by John Walker with his shield, later taking it later on.</li> 
        <li>John gets into a fight with Karli as well as with the Dora Milaje with hand to hand combat and the shield when he didn't take the Super Soldier Serum.</li>
        <li>The Dora Milaje throws a spear at John Walker as he impatiently tries to bring Zemo back into custody and fights him over bring Zemo into custody when the Dora Milaje want to bring Zemo to Wakanda to answer for his crimes.</li>
        <li>Ayo uses a technique that disables Bucky's arm causing it to fall off.</li> 
        <li>Karli threatens Sarah and her children over the phone in order to arrange a meeting between her and Sam so he could join the Flag Smashers and their cause.</li> 
        <li>Bucky and Sam go after Walker after finding out where he's going while engaging in fighting Karli. Bucky gets followed by Karli, while Walker fights the Flag Smashers bending a pipe on one of the Flag Smashers' hand, using his shield and hand to hand combat to fight them, and later deflecting being stabbed by knives with it.</li> 
        <li>Lemar gets knocked out and tied up, before using a knife to cut himself free and joining John and later Bucky and Sam in fighting the Flag Smashers resulting in Lemar's neck being snapped when getting kicked by Karli so hard into the stone pilar of the building. It's graphic but nothing bloody is shown.</li>
        <li>Walker brusts through the window of a building, lands on a van, and chaces after one of the Flag Smashers, attacking and later killing him in broad daylight in the town square in front of others. There is blood but there isn't any imagery of the dead body close up. There is blood shown on the shield which is the most shocking moment of the series.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Zemo drinks wine after a shower.</li> 
        <li>Sam says, "I can't believe [Zemo] pulled an El Chapo", in which describes Zemo's escape. El Chapo is a drug lord, in which it's very surprising to hear this reference in a Disney+/Marvel show.</li>
