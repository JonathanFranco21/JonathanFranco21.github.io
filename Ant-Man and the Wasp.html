  <h2>
    VIOLENCE/DISTURBING CONTENT
  </h2>

  <ul>
    <p>
      <li>The ICBM Soviet Union missle scene from <a href="Ant Man.html">Ant-Man</a> is revisited in more detail
        showing Janet going subatomic to take out the missle and entering the Quantum Realm, also showing the Quantum
        Realm scene from <a href="Ant Man.html">Ant-Man</a>.</li>
      <li>Scott sees a vision in where he saw janet playing hide and seek with Hope as a little girl, but then sees that
        he WAS Janet. It's weirdly hard put but later explained by Hank as Quantum Entanglement.</li>
      <li>There are some jump scares shown in this movie.</li>
      <li>Scott gets stung by an ant and gets knocked out to wake up small in Hope's car (the car, her, and Scott are
        small).</li>
      <li>After the events of <a href="Captain America Civil War.html">Captain: America: Civil War</a>, hank and Hope
        are not on speaking terms with Scott.</li>
      <li>There are oversized ants working to build the equipment for the Quantum Tunnel. Again, if viewers have insect
        phobias, they should avoid this movie.</li>
      <li>Hank, Hope, and Scott go to get a part for the Quantum Tunnel and are bein weatched by mysterious invisible
        figure. At the restaurant, Hope uses hand to hand combat fighting Sonny Burch's associates fter the deal doesn't
        go well. She also uses her blasters in her Wasp suit to knock them out. She fights them both big and small, in
        which they do shoot at her with guns. She fights them in the kitchen of the restaurant fighting them small as
        she avoids getting squashed with a meat hammer and killed by knives. She later encounters the myserious figure
        in which Scott helps fight her after it is shown she wants the part Hope and Hank needs in order to bring the
        Quantum Tunnel online. the figure grabs Hank by the throat, but what's scary is that she phases herself to grab
        hank by the INSIDE of his throat. This is more disturbing than it should be. She steals the lab afterwards.</li>
      <li>The figure suffers from Quantum Phasing from an accident she had earlier in her life, in which Ava (Ghost)
        reveals that her father Elihas Starr used to work for Hank, but after an experiment with the Quantum Tunnel went
        wrong, er parents were both killed, but she was alive with the phasing issues. The explosion from the accident
        is shown in which no fiery explosion is shown but some destruction is shown. The fiery aftermath is shown and is
        also revealed that SHIELD turned Ava into a weapon killling for them in which there is archieve footage of
        soldiers shooting at her in which she takes them out even snapping their necks.</li>
      <li>When getting the lab from Ghost's home, Scott and Hope get knocked out by her.</li>
      <li>Hank pretens to have a heart problem to get Bill to give him the Altoids tin to release the ants to get him,
        Hope, and Scott free from the chairs.</li>
      <li>Hope shoots at Ava stunning her.</li>
      <li>Sonny and his associates threatens Luis, Kurt, and Dave to tell him where Scott, Hank, and Hope are. Ava also
        threatens Luis for the information and eaves after he gives it to her.</li>
      <li>Ava originally wanted to either threaten Scott's daughter or wanting to hold her hostage until information can
        get out of him to get to Hank, but Bill tells her not to do so, because if she does, she wouldn't get his help
        anymore.</li>
      <li>The FBI aims their guns at Hank and Hope and are later arrested for it. </li>
      <li>Ava fight Scotts with hand to hand combat for a few brief moments.</li>
      <li>Hank uses the Quantum Tunnel to get Janet, which the Quantum Realm scenes and the monsters can be scary to
        younger viewers because of the psychadelic and mild grotesque imagery.</li>
      <li>A car chase between Burch and his associates against Hope, Scott, and Luis occur which has some car flips, car
        crashes, some shootings from guns and blasters, and some motorcyce flips, which aren't too violent like other
        MCU car chases.There is some hand to hand combat as well as some shootings during the car chase, while it's not
        as violent as other times it's somewhat concerning to some younger viewers.</li>
      <li>Ava gets the remote activating the lab at full size, destroying vehicles and some buildings as it reaches full
        scale. When Ava starts the extraction to heal herself, Janet starts to be molecularly torn apart. Hope and Scott
        fight Ava to shut down the extraction machine with hand to hand combat until the Quantum Vehicle crashes onto
        the platform.</li>
      <li>In the mid credit scene, the snap from <a href="Avengers Infinity War">Avengers: Infinity War</a> affectes
        Hope, hank, and Janet turning into dust leaving Scott stranded into the Quantum Realm.</li>
    </p>
  </ul>

  <h2>
    SUGGESTIVE CONTENT
  </h2>

  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hank tells Scott he might've entangled with Janet in tge Quantum Realm in which Scott misunderstands him as to
      having some sort of relationship with her.</li>
    <li>Hope comments on Bill and Scott's competition on how big they got with the Pym particles saying, "Well if you
      two are finished comparing size...", in which it's also an innuendo to the size of male genitals.
    <li>There seems to be more romantic chemistry between Hope and Scott, in which she kisses Scottt to help revive him
      later on.</li>
    <li>During Luis's story, Scott and Hope exaggerately make out. </li>
  </ul>
  </p>

    DRINKING/DRUG/GAMBLING CONTENT
