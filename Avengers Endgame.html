Thor joins the Guardians leaving Valkryie as Queen of New Asgard. This directly sets up <a href="Thor Love and Thunder.html"/>Thor: Love and Thunder</a> and possibly <a href="The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special.html"/>The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special</a> and <a href="Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3.html"/>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</a>.</li>
        <li>Steve puts the Stones back and decides to live the life he wanted, which is why he comes back as an old man handing the shield and the title of Captain America, which directly sets up the Disney+ series, <a href="The Falcon and the Winter Soldier Episode Menu.html"/>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</a>.</li>
