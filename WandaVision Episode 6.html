        VIOLENCE/DISTURBING CONTENT
      </h2>
      <ul>
      <p>
        <li>As Billy and Tommy run around the house, they yank Vision's newspaper out of his hand, in which he gets up, walks through the couch, grabs the newspaper, rolls it up, and smacks them with it, but it's played for laughs.</li>
        <li>Pietro puts Tommy in a headlock and gives him a noogie. </li> 
        <li>Pietro pretends to scare the twins when he wakes up as he chases them around the house with pietro exclaims, "Blood is thicker than water! I show you!" and also pretends to stab them. This is more for laughs.</li>
        <li>A flashback shows Wanda and Pietro tick or treating in Sokovia as children, with a car buring in the background in which Wanda's costume reminds him of the year they got typhus.</li>
        <li>Pietro scares Wanda off guard, in which it's also a slight jump scare.</li>
        <li>In the real world, Monica, Jimmy, and Darcy is escorted off of SWORD property because they're against what Hawyward did in <a href="WandaVision Episode 5.html"/>Episode 5</a>, in which Jimmy and Darcy beats upsome of the SWORD agents to sneak back onto base.</li> 
        <li>Pietro, Billy, and Tommy steal candy, vandalize property, and smash pumkins quickly.</li>
        <li>Some of the halloween costumes and makeup might scare younger viewers.</li>
        <li>Wanda talks with Pietro about some instances of their past after their parents died, in which comes unsettling when they slihlty argue.</li> 
        <li>When Vision walks through another part of Westview in some scenes, there are some people who are "stuck in a loop" and "aren't working properly" or no movement at all.</li> 
        <li>During the animatted commercial, a kid tries rto open a container of yogurt but shows during a timelapse of him turning into a dead body.</li> 
        <li>Pietro describes how he came to see Wanda because he sensed it after he was shot in Sokovia (this is referencing Pietro's death in <a href="Avengers Age of Ultron.html"/>Avengers: Age of Ultron</a> even though it's not the same Pietro). Wanda also briefly sees a Corpse Pietro with gray skin, white eyes, and the bullet wounds, in which it's a bit creepy and disturbing for younger viewers.</li>
        <li>Pietro describes as to why he came in which is why Wanda and pietro start to argue with each other, which causes tension between them.</li>
        <li>When Vision scans the area of Westview, it's creepy to hear everyone on one side, but silence on the other side. Vision sees only Agnes in the area that's not moving and that she's the only one that can move. The scene is unsettling when Vision uses his power to regain her memory again in which she says that she needs to help everyone in Westview. he has no memory of being an Avenger, in which she asks if she's dead but shes not, while Vision is, which is what he questions. he starts to mentally lose it and starts to laugh maniacally when describing Vision as dead until he uses his power to place her back in the "captive" state again.</li>
        <li>Darcy warns monica about re-entering the Hex, because of her cells being rewritten on a molecular level from ebing in the area, but Monica insists that she would do whatever she can to help Wanda.</li>
        <li>Pietro starts to question as to how she's doing everything in the Hex. The episode talks about grief, depression, and being alone which can be sensitive issues to talk about.</li>
        <li>As Vision starts to walk out of the Hex, he starts to die and pieces of him get sucked back into the Hex which can scare younger viewers.</li>
        <li>As Darcy tries to help Vision, she gets handcuffed to a SWORD vehicle and restrained by a SWORD agent.</li>
        <li>Billy can detect Vision in danger with his new super hearing in which he warns Wanda.</li>
        <li>Pietro offends Wanda by saying, "Don't sweat it sis. It's not like your dead husband can die twice", in which she blases him into some hay bales.</li>
        <li>The end scene can be scary and unsettling for younger viewers, in which the Hex expands and Wanda also freeses everything in order to expand the Hex. Everything turns into something that's in the era Wanda is in.</li>
        <li>The close up of Wanda's eyes glowinf red can be scary to young viewers.</li>

      <p>
        <ul>
        <li>Agnes wears sweat pants that spell out "naughty" in diamonds and the wins get a close up of her butt when recording and accidentally hits the camera to it, in which she tries to pry the camera from their hands, slightly fighting them.</li> 
        <li>Wanda wears a comic accurate costume for hallwoeen that can be a little suggestive for younger viewers and thanks Vision for wearing a comic accurate Halloween costume himself, in which he finds embarrasing but wears it anyways because it's the only clothes in his closet. It's played for laughs but can have a double meaning.</li>
        <li>Wanda and Vision flirt ith each other a few times briefly in English and one time in Spanish in which vision remarks, "I know you have a secret thing for Mexican wrestlers". Wanda replies, "Mi gusto mucho" (meaning "I like you a lot") and Vision replies "Chili con carne" (meaning chile with mea, this if for laughs).</li>
