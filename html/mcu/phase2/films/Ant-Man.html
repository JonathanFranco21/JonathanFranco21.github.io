  </h2>

  <h2>
    VIOLENCE/DISTURBING CONTENT
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <p>
      <li>Howard Stark was shown to try to replicate the Pym Particle formula in 1989 back when Hank Pym was a part of
        SHIELD. Hank isn't happy about it. After Mitchell Carson makes a comment on hank;s wife, who he could've saved
        from going subatomic, Hank bangs Mitchell's head to the table leaving him with a bloody ose and resigns from
        SHIELD.</li>
      <li>In the present day, Scoot Lang gets punched in the face in prison as a goodbye ritual. He's supposed to knock
        out an inmater named Peachy, but he only punches his chest and face before they say their goodbyes. Scott's
        friend, luis, picks him up from prison, commenting on scott's bruise/cut above his eye from prison. Luis also
        brags about being the only inmate to knock pechy out.</li>
      <li>Scott spent three years in San Quenting prison for breaking and entering and grand larceny.</li>
      <li>Luis tells Kurt and Dave about a robbery that Scott did which ended in driving a Bentley into a swimming pool,
        in which Scott says he doesn't consider himselce a robber for not wanting to result to violence.</li>
      <li>Darren Cross shows footage of soldiers being shot at and killed, thrown out of tanks, and taken out by a small
        being, which leads to Darren showing video game-like graphcis demonstrations on how the Yellowjacket suit could
        easily sneak into areas, kill enemies (with somehwat graphic detail of a man openig his briefcase and gets
        killed with a few laser penetrations shown as a well as army soldiers shooting at their enemies and a swarm of
        Yellojacket soldiers destroy them, and Yellowjacket soldiers taking a helicopter down). All of this is a
        simulation and is not real.</li>
      <li>Scott goes to his daughter's birthday party in Which Cassie tellls Scott's ex wfe coing back saying she's so
        happy she chocked on her drink.</li>
      <li>Scott gives Cassie an ugly scary looking talking rabbit plush, which she surpisnly loves.</li>
      <li>In the bathroom, Frank and Darren have a small disagreement over the Yellowjacket suit, in which he shoots
        Frank with a shrink ray that instead turns him into a small goop of graminc matter. It's graphic, but not too
        disturbing, but disgusting.</li>
      <li>Scott drills a hold into the safe door, pouring nitogren into the door causing the screws of the door to pop
        out like bullets and the door falls off landing on the inflatable mattress Scott puts underneath.</li>
      <li>Ants are seen throughout the movie, so it might not be for those who are scared of them.</li>
      <li>Darren uses a sheep ro conduct the shrinking experiments which turns the sheep into a small goop of organic
        matter like Frank. This can be highly upsetting to animal lovers.</li>
      <li>Some common day thing from a small point of view could seem moe violent than what it is like almost being
        drowned by the bath water, hanging onto a vinyl record and getting hit buy a record needle, almost being stepped
        on by dancers, being sucked into a vacuum cleaner, and being chased by a rat.</li>
      <li>After flying on the ant, Scott feels lightheaded and falls off losing consciousness.</li>
      <li>Scott wakes up to see bullet ants all around the bed he woke up in. It's kind of disgusting to watch.</li>
      <li>References to <a href="Avengers Age of Ultron.html" />Avengers: Age of Ultron</a> are made which mosty
        consists about the Sokovia battle.</li>
      <li>Hope helps Scott how to punch and fight others in which he gets punched and injured a few times, even to
        treating his injuries as well. scott also has to work with different types of ants which scare him at first when
        he's small. These scanes can be slightly scary though. Scott is supposed to shrink down to get through a keyhole
        and come out big from the other side, but this fails many timmes accidentally bumping into the door many times.
        At one point, Hope shows Scott how to controll the ants with the communicator, but her hanger towards Hank gets
        the ant to cover the chalendlier lights before Hank tells her to stop.</li>
      <li>Hank used to cover up Hope's mother's death by saying she died in a plane crash, but she actualy went
        subamatomic in 1987 when a soviet ICBM is laughnced at the US. Janet van Dyne (Hope's mother) goes subatomic to
        take out the ICBM that crashes into the ocean, but is stuck in the Quantum Realm for eternity.
      <li>
      <li>When trying to get a piec of technology from the abandoned Stark storage plce, it turns out to be the new
        Avengers Facility (shows at the end of <a href="Avengers Age of Ultron.html" />Avengers: Age of Ultron</a>. Sam
        (aka Falcon from <a href="Captain America The Winter Soldier.html" />Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a>)
        shows up thinking Scott is a threat, so they fight with hand to hand combat. Sam also shoots at Scott with guns.
        the fight is interesting because of how Scott goes from small to big during the fight.</li>
      <li>Luis sucker punches a few guards to turn the water pressure off nd another to get into the server after some
        bullet ants also land and bite the guard.</li>
      <li>Dave steals paxton's car to prevent Hank from being arrested in which the car is shown to have crashed into a
        tree.</li>
      <li>Hank punches Darren hard after finding out he's selling the Yellowjacket to HYDRA, in which who Mitchell works
        for.</li>
      <li>Scott and the ants fry the internet servers and him and Ant-thony fly through the circuits lmost getting
        electrocuted in their small size.</li>
      <li>The HYDRA agents and Mitchell 0 pull thei guns on Hank and Hope, but later Darren points his gun he took from
        a HYDRA agent at Hank almost killing him until Scott uses the Big Rings to break freefrom the glass container,
        but hank later gets shot in the shoulder by Darren. Hope points her gun at Darren and tries to help him. Darren
        reveals that when he visisted the house, he wanted to kill him and Hope but he wasn't ready to do it until that
        moment. Scott and Hope fight Mitchell and the HYDRA agents hand to hand and while Scott is both big and small.
        Some gun shots are heard. Scott goes to Hank to help him, but Darren puts his gun at the back of Scott's head,
        threatening to kill him, but Hope uses the communicator to get the ants to attack Darren.</li>
      <li>Security guards shoot at Scott and he fights them before running for cover in the Darren Industries model in
        the lab, but they shoot their guns at him making it seem like a battlefield than a miniature. Luis comes in to
        save Scott. by knocking out the security guards.</li>
      <li>Hank has a tank on his keychain which he makes bigger and it bursts from the building causing some
        destruction.</li>
      <li>Darren later shoots at Scot and the swarm of ants killing Ant-tony. You can see his detaxhed wing fall to the
        floor. Scott follows the helicopter and punches through the windows entering in small and punches some of the
        HYDRA associates unconscious in which Darren shoots at him, not caring about shooting the windows out or killing
        everyone in the helicopter. Scott gets swatted by Darren almost flies out of the helicopter, but gripping onto a
        seat belt when big, pulling himself in, seeing Darren in the Yellowjacket suit.</li>
      <li>Scott and the ants planted explosives inside the Pym Industried building, causing it to explode and suck
        itself into nothing, which doesn't hurt anyone.</li>
      <li>Darren shoots at Scott with the Yellowjacket suit with some explosions occuring. They fight with hand to hand
        combat both big and small. Darren shots the pilots causing some damage to the helicopter as well as set it on
        fire and it goes down, but Darren and Scott are fighting in a briefcase small. they later fight in a backyard
        destroying stuff before Scott smacks him into a bug zapper, but he's actually alive.</li>
      <li>Scott gets tased by Paxton.</li>
      <li>Cassie gets held hostage by Darren, but Darren and Scott go for anothwr fight in small size as Darren zaps him
        with his lasers, killing a few ants. Scott throws toy train cars at Darren and a few blocks. It's not overly
        violent when seen in a normal perspective, but it's worse in a small point of view. Small explosions are shown,
        but when Scott throws the big disks at Darren, but it causes an ant and a toy Thomas the Train to be huge with
        one scaring people and the other destroying part of the house and landing on a police car. the large ant could
        scare some younger viewers.</li>
      <li>Scott goes subatomic destroying the inside parts of Darren's yelowjacket suit causing Darren to shrink out of
        proportions, which can scare younger viewers. The Quantum Realm is very psycadelic looking and could
        scare/confuse viewers.</li>
      <li>The Wasp suit is teased for <a href="Ant Man and the Wasp.html" />Ant-Man and the Wasp</a> and the end credits
        is a scene from <a href="Captain America Civil War.html" />Captain America: Civil War</a></li>
