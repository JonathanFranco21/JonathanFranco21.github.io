          <li>The battle between Kaicilius and his followers against the Ancient One consists of hand to hand combat an magic weapons made of energy.

          <li>The second surgery is more detailed in which he drills into a patient's skull to use a tool to magnetically retrieve a bullet from the patient's skull in which shown on the X-Ray monitor. It's slightly unnerving and scary to watch. Somebody goes is shown.</li>
          <li>Stephen drives too fast that when it starts raining he looks at pictures of X-Rays on his car, getting distracted and crashes into another car before driving off the road and the car being mangled into a fence in the car almost being upside down. He's shown bruised and bloody period it's a little more graphic than other times in other MCU movies. It's shown that driving during the crash, the dashboard crushes stevenson's hands. Steven wakes up to find pins and stitches on his hands in which he suffers her nerve damage, and had 11 stainless steel pins in his bones, multiple torn ligaments, severe nerve damage in both hands, and was on the operating table for 11 hours. It's both sad and unsettling to see.</li>
          <li>Stephen is desperate to get his hands fixed including his surgery that passes a stent down the brachiale artery into the radial artery, in which some of the surgery is shown with somebody gosman nothing too graphic. When going to physical therapy, Stephen arogant Lee ask if another person was able to do the therapy exercises and healed completely in which the coordinator tells him about how he knew a guy who was in a really bad factory accident managed to walk after words after coming three times a week. Stephen tries many times to get his hands fixed but gets angry and frustrated to the point he tosses things aside. Stephen and Christine argue about Stephen's desire to be fixed that he hurts her feelings. Stephen tells Christine off really bad out of pain and anger of not being able to be a neurosurgeon anymore which is upsetting to see and heartbreaking.</li> 
          <li>Jonathan Pangborn has suffered spinal injuries and more telling Stephen to go to Kamar-Taj to get a miracle healing.</li>
          <li>A mysterious figure follows Stephen and saves him when he gets mugged and beaten up by thieves by causing but using hand to hand combat.</li>

          <li>The psychedelic trip is more dizzying somewhat disturbing an nightmares to see, visiting places like the Quantum Realm from <a href="Ant-Man.html"/>Ant-Man</a> and the Dark Dimension that appears later in the movie. It's also very flashy and very intense to watch.</li> 
          <li>Other sorcerers spar with each other but nothing violent.</li> 
          <li>Wong tell Stephen that books aren't forbidden, but per certain practices are. He also tells Stephen that if any books were to be stolen from the compound, he would be after them since he is the new librarian after the previous one was decapitated by Kaecilius, which is shown in the beginning.</li>
          <li>Kaecilius and his followers perform a ritual to gain power from dormammu the evil ruler of the dark dimension. They get deformed with they mark on their heads and can be scary and unsettling to look at period kaecilius uses the magic to alter the church they perform the ritual to create an after the church with the kaleidoscopic effects. This can be seen as demonic to some viewers.</li>
          <li>Master Hamir is revealed to be missing a hand, but he still is able to conjure spell to show that Stephen can learn even though his hands are messed up.</li>
          <li>The Ancient One leaves Stephen on the top of Mount Everest to test to see if he will pushes you go aside in concentrate to get back home in which he succeeds.</li>
          <li>Mordo and Stephen spar with hand to hand combat and with mystic magic filled weapons.</li>
          <li>All scenes that involve changing reality and their original state of form can be scary to look at but also visually interesting to see.</li>
          <li>Stephen uses a time spell to bring back the torn pages in the book of Cagliostro and almost threatens the safety of the Multiverse, almost creating alternate branches of reality, in possibly getting stuck in a time loop this will be explained in the Disney+ series, <a href="Loki Episode Menu.html"/>Loki</a> in a scientific point of view.</li>

          <li>Stephen here's from Kaecilius that Dormammu is to save the world, in which is the light. Kaecilius wants to have immortality with dark magic in which he rhetorically asked even on how does he think the ancient one lives along time.</li>
          <li>Stephen is stabbed by a follower of Kaecilius with a magic spear that he conjured. Blood is shown dripping from the stab wound and on his hands and is almost killed by the but the Cloak of Levitation saves him.</li>

Christine sells up the stab wound which showed up close.</li>
          <li>Kaecilius almost blows up the New York Sanctum but Stephen stop them. Mordo uses hand to hand combat and Stephen conscious the mirror dimension to prevent the explosion. The only downside is that it gives Kaecilius and his followers more power from the Dark Dimension.</li>
          <li>The chase scene is very intense and confusing sometimes dizzying as reality is bent in all ways throughout the sheets of New York. It should be advised to be careful when watching these scenes with younger viewers.</li>
          <li>It's revealed that Stephen was right about the Ancient One using dark magic from the Dark Dimension to have immortality as she is briefly shown with the mark on her forehead. Again this can be seen as demonic to some viewers.</li>
          <li>The Ancient One engages in to a fight against Kaecilius with both hand to hand combat and magic conjured weapons only to end up getting step with the magic spear bike ice elliason kicked or a portal outside the mirror dimension and into the real world and when Steven immortal follow her. She falls from a great distance from the portal crashing three glad shade , hitting the payment extremely hard. It's graphic, disturbing, unsettling, and scary to watch.</li>
          <li>Stephen wheels the Ancient One into the hospital and what she is shown bloody, bruised, and damaged really bad. This is the most graphically bloody scene in any Marvel movie in the MCU.</li>
          <li>The Ancient One flatlines on them, in which her and Stephen goes into the Astral Dminesion and talk about how Stephen is destined 2 for greatness and leader dies in both the physical and astral forms.</li>
          <li>Kaecilius and his followers are in Hong Kong to destroy the Hong Kong sanctum in which Wong gets ready to fight them with magic weapons.</li>
          <li>The aftermath of the Hong Kong sanctum is shown with people dead, and in danger with buildings on fire.</li>
          <li>Kaecilius is about to attack Stephen but he uses a time spell to reverse the damage from which the violence is in reverse, but it is scary to see.</li>
          <li>Stephen pulls Mordo out of the spell and Kaecilius and his followers pull themselves out of the spell as well, fighting Stephen and Mordo with magic conjured weapons as well as with hand to hand combat getting entrapped in the reverse destruction temporarily.</li>
          <li>Wong is revealed to be dead, killed by a pipe, but with the time spell, he comes back to life and Stephen takes him out of the time spell.</li>
          <li>There are reverse car crashes and reverse bodies that were dead come back to life. These scenes are unsettling but also horrific.</li>
          <li>Kaecilius injuries Stephen to the point that time stop. Steven travels to the Dark Dimension to put Dormamu in a time loop, being killed in graphic ways multiple times either being stabbed or vaporized or crushed, until Dormammu stops the attempt of merging the earth and the dark dimensions together and take the zealots with them.</li>
          <li>Kaecilius and the followers turn into Mindless Ones, creatures bound to serve door Mama for eternity in which they are dragged into the dark dimension. It's really creepy and disturbing.</li>
          <li>In the first end credits scene, Stephen meets with Thor to find Loki in which teases <a href="Thor Ragnarok.html"/>Thor: Ragnarok</a>.</li>
          <li>In the second end credit scene mortal visits Jonathan and strips the magic from him in which shows him in pain and can't walk again.

      <h2>Outcome</h2>

      <p class="overview">
        The Incredible Hulk is an underrated movie when it comes to Phase 1
        of the Infinity Saga as we not only get the only iteration of Edward 
        Norton's Bruce Banner/Hulk that makes him stand out in a great modern
        Hulk movie, but we also get stellar performances by the late William
        Hurt, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, and Ty Burrell. Hulk has been one of the most 
        popular characters that has been adapted in animation and live action
        movies and TV series so to see a version of Hulk that has been more
        deeply appreciated by fans of the Marvel Cinamtic Universe over time
        makes this movie more enjoyable to watch to set up <a class="reference" 
        href="/html/mcu/phase1/films/the-avengers.html">The Avengers</a>. Unlike 
        other Hulk movies and shows, this movie doesn't head into an origin story 
        and goes straight into a story that takes place within the same week of 
        the events of <a class="reference" href="/html/mcu/phase1/films/iron-man.html">
        Iron Man</a>, which makes it a refreshing movie to enjoy as it doesn't 
        rely on an origin story to tell a good Hulk story, but gives a great 
        introduction to the character, Abomination, to those who aren't familiar 
        with the comic books or with the character and a great refreshed introduction 
        to characters like General Thunderbolt Ross, his daughter, Betty Ross, and
        Dr. Samuel Sterns, who eventually becomes The Leader in the comics.
