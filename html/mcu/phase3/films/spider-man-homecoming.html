    </h2>

    <div id="violenceAndDisturbingContentArea">
      <ul>
        <li>The beggiing shows Bruce Banner on a chair making tests to see if the gamma radiation has effected him, which result into him turning into the Hulk, causing damage and destruction. Betty Ross is shown unconscious and later in a hospital bed recovering with bruises and an injured wrist.</li>
        <li>Soldiers shoot at the Hulk resulting to a soldier and General Ross getting thrown around the room. Blood is shown in the aftermath of the rampage</li> 
        <li>General Ross argues with Bruce, pushing and blaming him for Betty's injuries, latering ordering US soldiers to track Bruce down.</li>
        <li>Bruce takes meditation lessons and techniques to prevent turning into the Hulk, which also involves to be slapped.</li>
        <li>Bruce accidentally cuts himself and some blood is shown on a glass bottle.</li>
        <li>A confrontation hapens after Bruce helps a young woman from being harassed, in which causes a physical fight</li>
        <li>Bruce injects a needle into his arm to send a blood sample to "Mr. Blue" to examine for gamma poisoning.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Terrorists get blown up, beaten up, and shot at by Tony Stark in his Iron man suit and Yinsen in the distraction.</li>
        <li>Tony escapes and flies off from the cave he was held captive in after blowing up the terrorist's arsenal, but doesn't mak it far and crashes in the desrt with pieces of his armor flying everywhere.</li> 
        <li>The terrorists are later seen shooting at innocents in Gulmira, killing them and taking them hostage to blow up their village and be criminal war lords that control the country.</li>
        <li>Iron Man defends the citizens of Gulmira and make sure the terrorists don't harm them again.</li>
        <li>This results in the Air Force trying to take Iron Man down with missiles and machine guns not knowing who he is.</li> 
        <li>One fighter jet explodes and the Air Force pilot ejects himself out of the jet, but his chute doesn't open correctly so Iron Man does it for him while in midair.</li> 
        <li>There is one scene that is seen as disgusting as Tony asks Pepper to change his electromagnetic arc reactor he made in the cave in Afganistan and remove an exposed wire that's in his body to make way for the new arc reactor to be placed into his body that might send him into a cardiac arrest, with verbal and audible descriptions of bodily fluids being heard when she takes the copper wire out and replace the old arc reactor with the new one. There are arguments that are not too thrreatening and scenes where Tony Stark tests his new Iron Man armor in which some things explode or get destroyed for comcial purposes.</li> 
        <li>It is revealed that Obediah Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Tony Stark to take over Stark Industries, which causes in the leader to be executed by gunfire and for him to find Tony's old suit and use it as a model to make the Iron Monger suit that causes major destruction and explosions in the final battle.</li>
        <li> The Iron monger suit reveal can be scary to some since it looks as if ti comes out of a science fiction horror movie.<li>
        <li>Obediah Stane also shows to attempt to kill Tony Stark by using a devices that paralyzes Tony and Obediah steal's Stark's new chest arc reactor to power the Iron Monger suit, in which Stark is shown in a sickly manner that can scare viewers. There are scenes that can be seen as disturbing and unsettling for viewers, especially young children.</li>
        <li>The final battle consists of both Iron Man and Iron Monger using their armor and weapons to fight or kill each other which consists of explosions, gunfire, some descrutcion, care accidents. This scene can be scary to some, but tense to others. 
        <li>Tony later tells Pepper to overload the main arc reactor in the Stark Industries building to destroy it and its weapons, which results in a huge explosion killing Stane and almost killing Tony</li>

        <li>There are some suggestive/sexual references that parents should be  concerned about, which include a discussion of Tony on the cover of an issue of Maxim Magazine and not missing an issue when seeing twin models on one issue. 
        <li>There is an interaction between Tony, his friend Rhodey, and some of the flight attendents on the plane they're on on their way to Afganistan, in which the flight attendents wear suggestive clothing and suggestively dancing for them, while drunk, and a stripper pole is present in the plane.</li> 
        <li>Suggestive lines include, "You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life? I'm prepared to lose a few hours with you." (which is a conversation between a female reporter and Tony Stark and later leads to love-making and implications of sex and nudity in the aftermath) and "Let's face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing" (as a joke between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts after she sees him having the Iron Man armor being fit on him). </li>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>

    <p class="overview">
      The Incredible Hulk is an underrated movie when it comes to Phase 1
      of the Infinity Saga as we not only get the only iteration of Edward 
      Norton's Bruce Banner/Hulk that makes him stand out in a great modern
      Hulk movie, but we also get stellar performances by the late William
      Hurt, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, and Ty Burrell. Hulk has been one of the most 
      popular characters that has been adapted in animation and live action
      movies and TV series so to see a version of Hulk that has been more
      deeply appreciated by fans of the Marvel Cinamtic Universe over time
      makes this movie more enjoyable to watch to set up <a class="reference" 
      href="/html/mcu/phase1/films/the-avengers.html">The Avengers</a>. Unlike 
      other Hulk movies and shows, this movie doesn't head into an origin story 
      and goes straight into a story that takes place within the same week of 
      the events of <a class="reference" href="/html/mcu/phase1/films/iron-man.html">
      Iron Man</a>, which makes it a refreshing movie to enjoy as it doesn't 
      rely on an origin story to tell a good Hulk story, but gives a great 
      introduction to the character, Abomination, to those who aren't familiar 
      with the comic books or with the character and a great refreshed introduction 
      to characters like General Thunderbolt Ross, his daughter, Betty Ross, and
      Dr. Samuel Sterns, who eventually becomes The Leader in the comics.
