        SYNOPSIS
      </center></h2>
      <p class="overview">Now in the 80's sitcom era, Vision starts to suspect that everything isnt what it seems after finding out about the Maximoff Anomoly. In the real world, more starts to come forward as Hayward sees Wanda more of a threat and SWORD might not be what it seems.</p>

      <h2>
        VIOLENCE/DISTURBING CONTENT
      </h2>
      <ul>
      <p>
        <li>There are different instances where the sitcom tone changes to an awkward mysterious tone.</li>
        <li>Wanda and Visionargue amongst each other softly then loudly throughout the episode which starts to become unsettling. </li> 
        <li>Monica's flashbacks of what happened in the HEx flashes quickly, which can be scary or unsettling to younger viewers.</li>
        <li>Some previous footage from <a href="Captain America Civil War.html"/>Captain America: Civil War</a> is shown that enacted the Sokovia Accords, which makes Hayward assume that Wanda is a terrorist, but Jimmy Woo (from <a href="Ant Man and the Wasp.html"/>Ant-Man and the Wasp</a>) and Monica addresses that it's not the case, because she later joined and fought with the Avengers. Hayward claims that the surveliance footage from SWORD headquarters shows Wanda stealing Vision's corpse and ressurected him.</li>
        <li>A dog chewes at an electric socket and almost gets electrocuted.</li>
        <li>Monica shoots her gun at the clothes she wore that were affected by the Hex but it shows that they're bullet proof since th clothes are actually made of pure matter, meaning that Wanda is rewriting her reality with her powers.</li> 
        <li>Visions sees everyone in the office read an email about the maximoff Anomoly from Darcy simultaneously, which is creepy in context. Vision uses his powers to snap Norm out of the "80's sitcom reality" in which he says that someone is in his head and they she should be stopped before going back to the current reality they're in. This scene is creepy and unsettling.</li>
        <li>When piloting a drone into the Hex and trying to reason with Wanda, Hayward actually has the drone armed without telling anyone and orders a SWORD agent to shoot at her, but she emegeres from the Hex with the drone destroyed with many SWORD agents pointing their guns at her but she later uses her powers to mind control them and turn their guns on Hayward and then walks into the Hex again.</li>
        <li>Wanda, Billy, and Tommy find out their dog Sparky died by eating Agnes's azaleas in her garden.</li> 
        <li>One fighter jet explodes and the Air Force pilot ejects himself out of the jet, but his chute doesn't open correctly so Iron Man does it for him while in midair.</li> 
        <li>The last argument is unsettling due to the yelling and that they float in the air in poses that make it look like they might use their powers to fight each other.</li> 
      </p>
      </ul>
