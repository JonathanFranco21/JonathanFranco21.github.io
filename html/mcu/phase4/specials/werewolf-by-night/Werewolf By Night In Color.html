        Outcome
      </h2>

      <p class="overview">
        As a fan of Marvel and as a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and where it's taking it's new heroes,
        I found Marvel Studios' Special Presentation: Werewolf By Night to be a spectacular Halloween special that 
        not only pays homage to the classic monster movies of the 1930's, the 1940's, the 1950's, and even the early 1960's,
        but it also makes itself feel separate from the Marvel Cinematic Universe in its entirety! With a story that 
        doesn't require a new viewer to see any older entries in Phase 4 or the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole,
        this special brings a new genre into the ones it's already established. While entries like

        <a class="reference" href="What If S1E4.html">What If Season 1 Episode 4</a> and <a class="reference" href="What If S1E5.html">Season 1 Episode 5</a>, 
        and <a class="reference" href="Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.html">Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</a> 
        dove into the horror genre either to some degree or
