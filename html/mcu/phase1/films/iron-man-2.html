        <ul>
          <li>Tony tests blood toxicity level in the beginning which starts to get viewers concerned.</li>
          <li>During a hearing, the Iron Man suit is misclassified as a weapon.</li> 
          <li>North Korea makes an weaponized Iron Man suit seen in the footage with blood splatters. In another clip, Ivan 
            does same, but only explosions occur. The third clip shows Justin Hammer creating an Iron Man suit with the test 
            subject's back facing behind him this could be very graphic.</li>
          <li>Ivan created the Whiplash suit to cause harm and violence, in which he tests out the electrical whips that's 
            attached to the suit. </li>
          <li>Tony threatens to turn one of the robots into a wine rack and fries their motherboard, because it spills a mix 
            that helps Tony's blood toxicity levels lower. A second blood toxicity level reads 24%. It revealed that the arc 
            reactor in the Iron Man suit is increasing the blood toxicity levels and also killing him slowly even though he 
            needs to stay alive. The dark blue veins around the arc reactor on his chest can be disturbing. </li>
          <li>Tony and Pepper argue at some point.</li> 
          <li>Tony boxes Nappy and then with Natalie (a.k.a Black Widow). She tackles happy down in the ring as an exercise. </li>
          <li>Blood test service city level third test at 53%.</li>

            Intense car crashes occur along with explosions.</li> 
          <li>Happy drives his car with Pepper but on the wrong side of the race track trying to reach the Tony before he gets 
            killed. Tony tries to fight Ivan but he almost kills Tony, but gets bruises and injuries. Happy tries to run over 
            Ivan to avoid getting killed and ramm him into the fence several times this is seen as a gag.</li> 
          <li>Tony in the Iron Man suit fights Ivan at the racetrack but ends with Tony removing the arc reactor from Ivan suit 
            and powering it down to stop functioning.</li> 
          <li>Ivan beats up an inmate then has his prison number in prison guard helps them escape while disguising a bomb as a 
            general. Ivan breaks out of jail an beats up a prison guard, but later gets kidnapped by Justin Hammer's asociatives 
            to have Ivan work on with Hammer for revenge on Tony. </li>
          <li>Tony starts to look more sick and feels sick in which Rhodey helps him to replace the Palladium cartridge in his arc 
            reactor. Palladium concentration goes up to 89%. </li>
          <li>Tony accidentally then purposely destroys things in this house drunkenly at his birthday party. Rhodey tries to get 
            Tony to stop the party, while both in their in Iron Man suits, which ends up with both of them destroying stuff in Tony's 
            home and both are hitting each other with objects. That fight ends with both Iron Man and War Machine blasting hand repulsor 
            blasts at each other  causing major destruction in his home.</li>
          <li>Hammer wants to weaponize the Iron Man suit and shows Rhodey many automatic weapons to upgrade the armor.</li>
          <li>Tony destroys part of his house to recreate the arc reactor making a  Palladium substitute. Tony accidentally destroys 
            parts of his house redirecting a stronger laser to his new arcs prototype.</li>
          <li>Because Ivan isn't working with Hammer or his suits and working on his Whiplash suit, they take his new bird and stuff 
            it in a bag. Hammer keeps two bodyguards with Ivan, but it shows that he hung them, with blood being shown in his hands.</li>
          <li>Venko hacks the armors and War Machine's armor to kill Tony with missiles and machine guns. This scene is chaotic, violent, 
            and destructive. It can be scary for younger viewers. Explosions, gunfire, and injuries occur. Cars exploding and cheese scene 
            causing major destruction. Happy and Natasha fight off security guards at Hammer industries which can get intense for younger 
            viewers, involving pepper spray and an ear being bitten. Natasha takes out a bunch of guards and the aftermath is shown for 
            laughs. </li>
          <li>Tony fights Rhodey's hacked armore before Naasha reboots it. Tony and Pepper argue over Tony's almost dying but this is 
            for laughs. The final stand up between Tony and Rhodey against Venko is highly violent filled with hand to hand combat, gunplay, 
            and explosives, in which it ends with multiple injuries along with the fully gun fueled standoff, which is explosive. </li>
          <li>Venko reveals that hammer suits he worked on were rigged to self destruct, which almost kills Pepper, Tony, and Rhodey, but 
            destroys the Stark Expo area as a result.</li>

      <h2>Outcome</h2>

      <p class="overview">
        Iron Man is not only the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,
        but it's the movie that helped start the beginning of the modern crossover
        universe franchises in film history. While at first I only found it to 
        be a fair movie, I came to see how it's an important building block into
        the first phase of the Infinity Saga. Acting from Robert Downey Jr., 
        Jeff Bridges, Terrance Howard, and Gwenyth Paltrow and Jon Favreau's 
        mutiple roles as actor, executive producer, and director helps bring 
        Stan Lee's vision of Iron Man to life and thanks to the additional 
        contributions of Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, Larry Lieber, and Don Heck, 
        bringing Iron Man's iron suit design and Tony Stark's personality brought
        to life, with additional contributions due to Robert Downey Jr.'s supurb
        acting that sets the modern standard to Iron Man's personality and character 
        development throughout the Infinity Saga. While some might feel it's 
        small scaled compared to the rest of the Infinity Saga, it's a solid 
        first entry that sets up Phase 1's solid story that leads up to 
        the now modern classic superhero teamup film that set the standards
        to future superhero films, <a class="reference"
