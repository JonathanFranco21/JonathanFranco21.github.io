        <li>Tony threatens to turn one of the robots into a wine rack and fries their motherboard, because it spills a mix that helps Tony's blood toxicity levels lower. A second blood toxicity level reads 24%. It revealed that the arc reactor in the Iron Man suit is increasing the blood toxicity levels and also killing him slowly even though he needs to stay alive.

        <li>Ivan beats up an inmate then has his prison number in prison guard helps them escape while disguising a bomb as a general.

        <li>Tony starts to look more sick and feels sick in which Rhodey helps him to replace the Palladium cartridge in his arc reactor. Palladium concentration goes up to 89%. </li>
        <li>Tony accidentally then purposely destroys things in this house drunkenly at his birthday party. Rhodey tries to get Tony to stop the party, while both in their in Iron Man suits, which ends up with both of them destroying stuff in Tony's home and both are hitting each other with objects. That fight ends with both Iron Man and War Machine blasting hand repulsor blasts at each other  causing major destruction in his home.</li>
        <li>Hammer wants to weaponize the Iron Man suit and shows Rhodey many automatic weapons to upgrade the armor.</li>
        <li>Tony destroys part of his house to recreate the arc reactor making a  Palladium substitute. Tony accidentally destroys parts of his house redirecting a stronger laser to his new arcs prototype.</li>
        <li>Because Ivan isn't working with Hammer or his suits and working on his Whiplash suit, they take his new bird and stuff it in a bag. Hammer keeps two bodyguards with Ivan, but it shows that he hung them, with blood being shown in his hands.</li>
        <li>Venko hacks the armors and War Machine's armor to kill Tony with missiles and machine guns. This scene is chaotic, violent, and destructive. It can be scary for younger viewers. Explosions, gunfire, and injuries occur. Cars exploding and cheese scene causing major destruction. Happy and Natasha fight off security guards at Hammer industries which can get intense for younger viewers, involving pepper spray and an ear being bitten. Natasha takes out a bunch of guards and the aftermath is shown for laughs. </li>
        <li>Tony fights Rhodey's hacked armore before Naasha reboots it. Tony and Pepper argue over Tony's almost dying but this is for laughs. The final stand up between Tony and Rhodey against Venko is highly violent filled with hand to hand combat, gunplay, and explosives, in which it ends with multiple injuries along with the fully gun fueled standoff, which is explosive. </li>
        <li>Venko reveals that hammer suits he worked on were rigged to self destruct, which almost kills Pepper, Tony, and Rhodey, but destroys the Stark Expo area as a result.</li>
