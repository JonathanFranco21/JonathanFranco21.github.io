      <h2>Outcome</h2>

      <p class="overview">
        The Incredible Hulk is an underrated movie when it comes to Phase 1
        of the Infinity Saga as we not only get the only iteration of Edward 
        Norton's Bruce Banner/Hulk that makes him stand out in a great modern
        Hulk movie, but we also get stellar performances by the late William
        Hurt, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, and Ty Burrell. Hulk has been one of the most 
        popular characters that has been adapted in animation and live action
        movies and TV series so to see a version of Hulk that has been more
        deeply appreciated by fans of the Marvel Cinamtic Universe over time
        makes this movie more enjoyable to watch to set up <a class="reference" 
        href="/html/mcu/phase1/films/the-avengers.html">The Avengers</a>. Unlike 
        other Hulk movies and shows, this movie doesn't head into an origin story 
        and goes straight into a story that takes place within the same week of 
        the events of <a class="reference" href="/html/mcu/phase1/films/iron-man.html">
        Iron Man</a>, which makes it a refreshing movie to enjoy as it doesn't 
        rely on an origin story to tell a good Hulk story, but gives a great 
        introduction to the character, Abomination, to those who aren't familiar 
        with the comic books or with the character and a great refreshed introduction 
        to characters like General Thunderbolt Ross, his daughter, Betty Ross, and
        Dr. Samuel Sterns, who eventually becomes The Leader in the comics.
