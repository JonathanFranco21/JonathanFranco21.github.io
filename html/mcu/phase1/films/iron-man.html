      </h2>

      <div id="violenceAndDisturbingContentArea">
        <ul>
          <li>Violence is part of the plot of the movie, in which Stark Industries makes weapons.</li>
          <li>There are some intense distrubing moments in the movie, like terrorists attacking US soldiers with machine
            guns and bombs, holding Tony Stark hostage, performing a surgery on him that they implant an electromagnet to
            his chest, which is attached to a car battery (like a bomb) while also seeing disturbing imagery of the surgery
            and its aftermath resulting in Tony horrified with seeing the electromagnet in his chest after pulling a
            procedure tube from his nose, which can be seen as unsettling and disgusting for some viewers, especially to
            young children. </li>
          <li>Stark is also refered to as "The Merchant of Death" and "The most famous mass murderer in the history of
            America" by the terrorists and blackmail him to make them a Jericho missile for them and be set free or else he
            is executed by them.</li>
          <li>There is mention of Howard Stark's death in a car accident, which is later explored more in <a class="reference" 
              href="/html/mcu/phase2/Captain America The Winter Soldier.html">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a> and <a class="reference" 
              href="/html/mcu/phase3/Captain America Civil War.html">Captain America: Civil War</a>.</li>
          <li>the device is hooked up to a car bettery, in which it's an electromagnet that keeps he schrapnel from getting
            into Tony's body. There is some in his body even though Yinsen took some out.</li>
          <li>Terrorists also push, shovel, and threaten Tony Stark and his "cell mate" Yinsen, who helps save Tony's life,
            but also gets killed by the terrorists of the Ten Rings organization after he causes a distraction to help him
            and Stark escape by taking a gun and shoot at the terrorists randomly at them.</li>
          <li>Terrorists get blown up, beaten up, and shot at by Tony Stark in his Iron man suit and Yinsen in the
            distraction.</li>
          <li>Tony escapes and flies off from the cave he was held captive in after blowing up the terrorist's arsenal, but
            doesn't mak it far and crashes in the desrt with pieces of his armor flying everywhere.</li>
          <li>The terrorists are later seen shooting at innocents in Gulmira, killing them and taking them hostage to blow
            up their village and be criminal war lords that control the country.</li>
          <li>Iron Man defends the citizens of Gulmira and make sure the terrorists don't harm them again.</li>
          <li>This results in the Air Force trying to take Iron Man down with missiles and machine guns not knowing who he
            is.</li>
          <li>One fighter jet explodes and the Air Force pilot ejects himself out of the jet, but his chute doesn't open
            correctly so Iron Man does it for him while in midair.</li>
          <li>There is one scene that is seen as disgusting as Tony asks Pepper to change his electromagnetic arc reactor he
            made in the cave in Afganistan and remove an exposed wire that's in his body to make way for the new arc reactor
            to be placed into his body that might send him into a cardiac arrest, with verbal and audible descriptions of
            bodily fluids being heard when she takes the copper wire out and replace the old arc reactor with the new one.
            There are arguments that are not too thrreatening and scenes where Tony Stark tests his new Iron Man armor in
            which some things explode or get destroyed for comcial purposes.</li>
          <li>It is revealed that Obediah Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Tony Stark to take over Stark Industries, which
            causes in the leader to be executed by gunfire and for him to find Tony's old suit and use it as a model to make
            the Iron Monger suit that causes major destruction and explosions in the final battle.</li>
          <li> The Iron Monger suit reveal can be scary to some since it looks as if ti comes out of a science fiction
            horror movie.</li>
          <li>Obediah Stane also shows to attempt to kill Tony Stark by using a devices that paralyzes Tony and Obediah
            steal's Stark's new chest arc reactor to power the Iron Monger suit, in which Stark is shown in a sickly manner
            that can scare viewers. There are scenes that can be seen as disturbing and unsettling for viewers, especially
            young children.</li>
          <li>The final battle consists of both Iron Man and Iron Monger using their armor and weapons to fight or kill each
            other which consists of explosions, gunfire, some descrutcion, care accidents. This scene can be scary to some,
            but tense to others.</li>
          <li>Tony later tells Pepper to overload the main arc reactor in the Stark Industries building to destroy it and
            its weapons, which results in a huge explosion killing Stane and almost killing Tony</li>

          <li>Tony Stark is more of a womanizer and a "player" in the beginning, while he does have feelings for his

          but more on Tony's end.</li>
          <li>There are some suggestive/sexual references that parents should be concerned about, which include a discussion
          of Tony on the cover of an issue of Maxim Magazine and not missing an issue when seeing twin models on one issue.</li>
          <li>There is an interaction between Tony, his friend Rhodey, and some of the flight attendents on the plane they're
          on on their way to Afghanistan, in which the flight attendents wear suggestive clothing and suggestively dancing
          for them, while drunk, and a stripper pole is present in the plane.</li>
          <li>Suggestive lines include, "You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life? I'm prepared to lose a few hours with
          you." (which is a conversation between a female reporter and Tony Stark and later leads to love-making and
          implications of sex and nudity in the aftermath) and "Let's face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me
          doing" (as a joke between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts after she sees him having the Iron Man armor being fit on
          him).</li>

      <h2>Outcome</h2>

      <p class="overview">
        Iron Man is not only the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,
        but it's the movie that helped start the beginning of the modern crossover
        universe franchises in film history. While at first I only found it to 
        be a fair movie, I came to see how it's an important building block into
        the first phase of the Infinity Saga. Acting from Robert Downey Jr., 
        Jeff Bridges, Terrance Howard, and Gwenyth Paltrow and Jon Favreau's 
        mutiple roles as actor, executive producer, and director helps bring 
        Stan Lee's vision of Iron Man to life and thanks to the additional 
        contributions of Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, Larry Lieber, and Don Heck, 
        bringing Iron Man's iron suit design and Tony Stark's personality brought
        to life, with additional contributions due to Robert Downey Jr.'s supurb
        acting that sets the modern standard to Iron Man's personality and character 
        development throughout the Infinity Saga. While some might feel it's 
        small scaled compared to the rest of the Infinity Saga, it's a solid 
        first entry that sets up Phase 1's solid story that leads up to 
        the now modern classic superhero teamup film that set the standards
        to future superhero films, <a class="reference"
