      <h2>
        VIOLENCE/DISTURBING CONTENT
      </h2>
      <ul>
      <p>
        <li>The way the objects phase out and turn into alternate era versions of the objects throughout the episode can be either mysterious or eerie.</li>
        <li>Wanda talks with the interviewer about intentionally expanding the Hex, which also shows the chaos outside the Hex. </li> 
        <li>Billy talks bout his head hurting and feeling weird, which results to possibly his powers.</li>
        <li>Billy talks about Pietro's comment on "re-killing" Vision from <a href="WandaVision Episode 6.html"/>Episode 6</a> in which Wanda responds to him not being the twins' uncle and that she believes now that everything is meaningless, but the twins looks at this in confusion and a bit creeped out. This is a little unsettling for younger viewers to understand.</li>
        <li>Agnes says for the twins to spend time with her and that she doesn't bite, but responds privately "I actually did bite a kidf once" as a gag in the sitcom.</li>
        <li>Jimmy and Monica find out that Hayward was originally tracking Vision with tech to weaponize him. This was partially revealed in <a href="WandaVision Episode 6.html"/>Episode 6</a>.</li> 
        <li>When one of the circus performers grabs Darcy's arm forcefully to get her and Vision to perform in the circus after Vision uses his powers to restore Darcy's memory, she punches the performer in the house, with a comical sound covering the impat and her and Vision steal a van to reach back to Wanda.</li>
        <li>The interviewer asks Wanda if the reason why things are going wrong is if she deserves it, which makes things unsettling or uneasy for viewers.</li>
        <li>When Monica boards the space rover , she rams into the Hex wall to try to break in. Although it partially goes through, the Hex looks like it's eating the rover in which Monica has to evacuate the rover. After she escapes, it lifts up into the air and has half of it pulled in before it "spits' it back out as half truck/half rover when being rewritten by the Hex. It sails through the air before crashing on the ground. The scene can be scary to some viewers.</li> 
        <li>After the incident, Monica decides to go through the Hex without any protection besides the space suit. When trudging through the Hex walls, it seems like the different eras of Mocia separate from her, which feels a bit like <a href="Doctor Strange.html"/>Doctor Strange</a>. She later hears the voices of others from her past like her mother, Maria Rambeau, Carol Danvers, Nick Fury, Dr. Harley, Jimmy, and Hayward from previous episodes of <a href="WandaVision Episode Menu.html"/>WandaVision</a> and <a href="Captain Marvel.html"/>Captain Marvel</a>. She merges back together with eyes glowing as she reaches the other side, gaining superpowers.</li> 
        <li>Darcy retells Vision on how he died during the events of <a href="Avengers Infinity War.html"/>Avengers: Infinity War</a>.</li> 
        <li>Wanda uses her powers to try to fight with Monica after she tries to convince her of what's happening outside of the Hex with every neighbor staring and Agnes intervening later. </li>
        <li>The atmosphere changes when Wanda is in Agnes' home to feel like a horror episode, in which Agnes says the twins are playing in the basement after Wanda asks where they were. Wanda later goes to the basement to find an evil-like lair connected to the basement which holds spells, exlirs, potions, and creepy symbols on some parts of the room. This could be disturbing and scary to some younger viewers and for those who on't like the horror genre.</li>
        <li>Agnes reveals to be another witch named Agatha Harkness in which she keeps a book that glows on a dresses that contains evil spells. She uses her powers to show Wanda everything that she did in the Hex, in which her eyes gow purple. It's shown that Agath sent Se√±or Scratchy to "help" Vision and Wanda during the Talent Show in <a href="WandaVision Episode 2.html"/>Episode 2</a>, she sent Pietro in <a href="WandaVision Episode 5.html"/>Episode 5</a>, she faked her interaction with Vision in <a href="WandaVision Episode 6.html"/>Episode 6</a>, and was the one that killed Sparky in <a href="WandaVision Episode 5.html"/>Episode 5</a>.</li>
        <li>It's also revealed that pietro is working for Agatha after he sneaks up on Monica when she investigates what's really happening in Westview.</li>

      <h2>
        SUGGESTIVE CONTENT
      </h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
        <li>Wanda takes the sheets off to get up from bed, but she's still in her suggestive Halloween costume in which she's embarassed/ashamed.</li> 
        <li>When Vision sees Darcy in the Hex, they have a conversation in which he tries to talk to her about them seeing each other outside the hex before it expands, but Darcy (mind-wiped by the hex) thinking Vision is hitting on her, which is meant for laughs after she mistakingly turns him down for a date. </li>
        <li>Wanda asks if she could do anything for Agnes as she goes babysit the twins, in which she responds to look at a mole she can't see in a specific lower back area, in which she later asks the twins to do so (nothing is shown).</li> 
        <li>Suggestive lines include, "You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life? I'm prepared to lose a few hours with you." (which is a conversation between a female reporter and Tony Stark and later leads to love-making and implications of sex and nudity in the aftermath) and "Let's face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing" (as a joke between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts after she sees him having the Iron Man armor being fit on him). </li>
        <li>When Vision tries to persuade Darcy to help him, she decides to go out with him reluctantly. This is a running gag in which Darcy thiks Vision was trying to ask her out, in which he's really asking for help.</li> 
        <li>Darcy tells Vision that when watching "wandaVision" (the sitcom outside the Hex), she knows that the love that Vision and Wanda has for each other as real, which is supposed to be a romantic compliment.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>The commercial for the episode is about an anti-depressan medication called Nexus, which discusses on how it's a "realtiy-changing" medication. This is more for adults to undersand in which parental guidance and explanation should be held to help younger viewers understand what it's for (although not recommended to be viewed be some viewers, especially younger viewers).</li> 
        <li>Wanda takes some medication that looks like Tylenol to relieve stress.</li>
