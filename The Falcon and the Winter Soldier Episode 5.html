Some incidents shown include John ripping Sam's mechanical wings off, John knocking Buky out, and Sam and Bucky taking the shield off of John's arm, dislocating it (with the bone snapping heard), which is also a throwback scene to <a href="Avengers Infinity War.html"/>Avengers: Infinity War</a> where Mantis, Tony, Peter Quill, Drax, Stephen, and Peter Parker were trying to take the Infinity Gauntlet off of Thanos.</li>
        <li>Bucky points his gun at Zemo, pulls the trigger at him, but reveals that the ullets weren't in the gun and lets the Dora Milaje take him to the Raft ( the prison first shown in <a href="Captain America Civil War.html"/>Captain America: Civil War</a>).</li> 
        <li>Sam visits Isaiah again with more disturbing descriptions and imagery of what he went through as a Super Soldier and and Africa American man. He shows nasty healing scars and describes on how he was threatened to be killed if he is shown to be alive.</li>
        <li>John lies to Lema's famil about who killed Lemar.</li>
        <li>Sam trains with the shield, aiming it at differet objects protected with padding.</li>
