In reality, the Collector's collection is destroyed and on fire. Drax and Mantis break into different shapes when Thanos uses the Infinity Stones after Gamora tries to kill the real Thanos. Peter threatens to kill Thanos after Thanos tries to take Gamora as a hostage. Peter attempts to shoot her like he promised but Thanos uses the Stones to turn it into bubbles. </li>

Groot uses his arm as the handle of the stormbreaker, breaking it off himself, but it grows back with no blood shown. </li>
        <li>When Stephen goes through alternate realities, it's kind of scary to see. Out of 14,000,605 outcomes, they only win in one outcome parentheses which will be seen in <a href="Avengers Endgame.html"/>Avengers: Endgame</a>.</li>
        <li>The Red Skull, which was introduced in <a href="Captain America The First Avenger.html"/>Captain America: The First Avenger</a>, is revealed to be the keeper of the Soul Stone on Vormir, which can be scary to some viewers.

        <li>During the fight on what conduct, there are many explosions and destruction that occurs. Many Black Order monsters get dismembered and/or killed when trying to get past the force field. Rhodey unleashes bombs on them blowing up some of them. The battle on Wakanda is a second largest battle in the MCU which is there is consistent hand to hand combat, machine guns fire, explosion occur, spear stabbings and killings, knives, etc. The battle on Wakanda is very big scaled with large body counts in which makes the description hard to describe the whole battle in detail.</li>

        <li>Thor aims and throws the Stormbreaker at Thanos's chest, but it tells him he should have went for the head snapping his fingers completing his mission. Half of the universe turns to dust which is sad and scary to see. Bucky, Sam, T'Challa, Wanda, and Groot turn to dust in Wakanda also with Vision dead, while Mantis, Drax, Quill, Stephen, and Parker turned to dust on Titan, leaving Tony, Nebula, Steve, Thor, Natasha, Okoye, M'Baku, Rocket, Rhodey, and Bruce as the only survivors.</li>
