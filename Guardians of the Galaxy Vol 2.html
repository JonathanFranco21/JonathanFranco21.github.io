      <b><center>OVERALL CONTENT(CONTENT CONTAINS SPOILERS!!)</center></b>
      <h2>
        VIOLENCE/DISTURBING CONTENT
      </h2>
      <ul>
      <p>
        <li>Violence is part of the plot of the movie, in which Stark Industries makes weapons.</li>
        <li>There are some intense distrubing moments in the movie, like terrorists attacking US soldiers with machine guns and bombs, holding Tony Stark hostage, performing a surgery on him that they implant an electromagnet to his chest, which is attached to a car battery (like a bomb) while also seeing disturbing imagery of the surgery and its aftermath resulting in Tony horrified with seeing the electromagnet in his chest after pulling a procedure tube from his nose, which can be seen as unsettling and disgusting for some viewers, especially to young children. </li> 
        <li>Stark is also refered to as "The Merchant of Death" and "The most famous mass murderer in the history of America" by the terrorists and blackmail him to make them a Jericho missile for them and be set free or else he is executed by them.</li>
        <li>Terrorists also push, shovel, and threaten Tony Stark and his "cell mate" Yinsen, who helps save Tony's life, but also gets killed by the terrorists of the Ten Rings organization after he causes a distraction to help him and Stark escape by taking a gun and shoot at the terrorists randomly at them.
        <li>Terrorists get blown up, beaten up, and shot at by Tony Stark in his Iron man suit and Yinsen in the distraction.</li>
        <li>Tony escapes and flies off from the cave he was held captive in after blowing up the terrorist's arsenal, but doesn't mak it far and crashes in the desrt with pieces of his armor flying everywhere.</li> 
        <li>The terrorists are later seen shooting at innocents in Gulmira, killing them and taking them hostage to blow up their village and be criminal war lords that control the country.</li>
        <li>Iron Man defends the citizens of Gulmira and make sure the terrorists don't harm them again.</li>
        <li>This results in the Air Force trying to take Iron Man down with missiles and machine guns not knowing who he is.</li> 
        <li>One fighter jet explodes and the Air Force pilot ejects himself out of the jet, but his chute doesn't open correctly so Iron Man does it for him while in midair.</li> 
        <li>There is one scene that is seen as disgusting as Tony asks Pepper to change his electromagnetic arc reactor he made in the cave in Afganistan and remove an exposed wire that's in his body to make way for the new arc reactor to be placed into his body that might send him into a cardiac arrest, with verbal and audible descriptions of bodily fluids being heard when she takes the copper wire out and replace the old arc reactor with the new one. There are arguments that are not too thrreatening and scenes where Tony Stark tests his new Iron Man armor in which some things explode or get destroyed for comcial purposes.</li> 
        <li>It is revealed that Obediah Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Tony Stark to take over Stark Industries, which causes in the leader to be executed by gunfire and for him to find Tony's old suit and use it as a model to make the Iron Monger suit that causes major destruction and explosions in the final battle. </li>
        <li>Obediah Stane also shows to attempt to kill Tony Stark by using a devices that paralyzes Tony and Obediah steal's Stark's new chest arc reactor to power the Iron Monger suit, in which Stark is shown in a sickly manner that can scare viewers. There are scenes that can be seen as disturbing and unsettling for viewers, especially young children.</li>

      <h2>
        SUGGESTIVE CONTENT
      </h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
        <li>Tony Stark is more of a womanizer and a "player" in the beginning, while he does have feelings for his secretary, Pepper Potts, in which they do have some slight romantic interaction and fliration between each other, but more on Tony's end.</li> 
        <li>There are some suggestive/sexual references that parents should be  concerned about, which include a discussion of Tony on the cover of an issue of Maxim Magazine and not missing an issue when seeing twin models on one issue. 
        <li>There is an interaction between Tony, his friend Rhodey, and some of the flight attendents on the plane they're on on their way to Afganistan, in which the flight attendents wear suggestive clothing and suggestively dancing for them, while drunk, and a stripper pole is present in the plane.</li> 
        <li>Suggestive lines include, "You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life? I'm prepared to lose a few hours with you." (which is a conversation between a female reporter and Tony Stark and later leads to love-making and implications of sex and nudity in the aftermath) and "Let's face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing" (as a joke between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts after she sees him having the Iron Man armor being fit on him). </li>
      </ul>
