      VIOLENCE/DISTURBING CONTENT
    </h2>
    <ul>
    <p>
      <li>Nick Fury and Maria Hill arrive at Ixctenco, Mexico seeing the city destroyed and the aftermath of the destruction, saying a cyclon with a face destroyed it.</li>
      <li>Nick and Maria pull their guns on Quentin before firing at a sand monster and Quentin uses his powers to fight it.</li> 
      <li>Footage of the Snap and the Blip which were both taken place during the events from <a href="Avengers Infinity War.html"/>Avengers: Infinity War</a> and <a href="Avengers Endgame.html"/>Avengers: Endgame</a> is shown, which can scare younger viewers.</li>
      <li>It's revealed that MJ's favorite flower is the Black Dhalia because of the Black Dhalia murders.</li>
      <li>Peter feels stressed from the pressure of being "the next Tony Stark" after Tony's death in <a href="Avengers Endgame.html"/>Avengers: Endgame</a>.</li>
      <li>A water monster makes its attack in venice destroying buildings, leaving people in danger, flooding the streets, and leaving destruction until Quentin comes to fight it. He uses his powers to deal with the water monster, in which no explosions are present but destruction is shown.</li>
      <li>Peter uses webbing to try to piece and bring buildings back together, but gets hit with a bell tower (the bell only) a few times almost getting knocked out before it's complete destroyed.</li>
      <li>Nick shoots Ned in the neck with a tranquilizer dart.</li>
      <li>Because so many people knockon the door interrupting Peter and Nick's conversation he tells him that if another person knocks on the door, they would be going to another funeral, another reference to both of the attending Tony's funeral in <a href="Avengers Endgame.html"/>Avengers: Endgame</a>.</li>
      <li>Quentin Beck (a.k.a Mysterio) tells Peter, Nic and Maria that his homework and family in Dimension 833 (which the Multiverse is slightly explored in <a href="Doctor Strange.html"/>Doctor Strange</a>) were killed and destroyed by the Elementals an that the fire Elemental will attack Prague.</li> 
      <li>After Brad sees Peter and an agent working for Nick together to test his new suit, he takes a photo of them in which the agent pulls her gun at him when he's walking away from them in which Peter tells her to not shoot him.</li>
      <li>When Peter activates EDITH, he accidentally activates a drone to attack  and kill brad while on the bus, but uses his webs discretely to steer the bus away from the drone shooting at them, in which they crash into a guardrail while they're on the side of a mountain, but Peter uses his webs to destroy the drone, exploding.</li>
      <li>Peter accidentallt knocks Flash out after Flash tries on EDITH and doesn;t want to give it back to Peter.</li> 
      <li>There are some tense argument scenes, but it's a little unsettling.</li> 
      <li>The battle between the fire Elemental and Quentin and Peter is full of action, some destruction, some explosions, people in danger, and some scary imagery. Beck uses his powers to fight the fire Elemtnal off later destroying it with his powers causing a huge explosion into particles.</li> 
      <li>Peter aims his webs at the Ferris Wheel but it sticks to something invisible in which MJ sees the part from a distance.</li>
      <li>The Elementals and Quentin's backstory is all fake in which he wanted to use this to be better than the Avengers.</li>
      <li>Quentin and his colleagues test the drones to fool everyone. Shooting is shown from the weaponized drones. Quentin later threatens to kill peter and anyone who wants to "mess up" the plan, by shooting them with the drones.</li>
      <li>The first illusion scene is rather disturbing and unsettling and can be scary for younger viewers. Nick gets shot at by the drones that camoflague the building. peter also gets shot. The illusion shows horror-like imagery that is slightly similar to the psycadelic imagery from <a href="Doctor Strange.html"/>Doctor Strange</a>. This includes MJ getting choked by Quentin, Spider-Man reflections attacking Peter, a zombie Tony Stark (skeleton and damaged armor shown) trying to attack Peter, close up imagery of spiders, Quentin taking his head off of his head, being shot, and disguised as Nick Fury, with Peter fighting illusions. This scene ends with Peter being hit by a bullet train. It's quick, but very brutal after Quentin's illusions try to mess with him. This can be very unsettling and upsetting. heis shown bruised and bloody then later waking up ia prison cell in the Netherlands.</a>
      <li>The end battle is bigger than the battle from <a href="Spider-Man Homecoming.html"/>Spider-Man: Homecoming</a> with more explosions and more intensity. The "combined Elemental monster" can be scary to look at even though it's a holographic projection image.</li>
      <li>Happy stitches up peter's injuries in the jet, but nothing graphic is shown.</li>
      <li>Many cars epxlode, people are in danger, some injuried are shown, parts of the bridge gets destroyed, and the drones cause huge amounts of damage making the illusions as realistic as possible by using sonic cannons to aomplify the destruction more.</li>
      <li>Quentin uses the drones to try to kill Peter, ned, MJ, and Betty, which is upsetting to see.</li>
      <li>Peter gets shot at by drones multiple times, is set on fire a few times, but later puts it out, and destroys the drones in multiple ways causing huge explosions and major damage and some destruction.</li>
      <li>Happy lands the jet to rescue Ned, MJ, Betty, and Flash, but Beck used a drone to blow it up so they go somewhere else to hide. They run into the Crown jewels vault to hide while getting shot at by the drones. British soldiers fire their guns at the drones taking out one of them, but the other stills chases after the group. They hide behind a few protected artifacts in which MJ grabs a mace and almost dropis it on the ground, but the drone shoots at them again when Bety knocks over the suit of armor (with the drone first shooting at the armo) and MJ hits it with the mace and they run into the main vault, locking it, while Happy throws a shield at it. The drone still shoots at them before using a laser to cut the lock open.</li>
      <li>Peter uses. part broken off of a drone anf the Tower Bridge sign to protect himself and take out more of them drones, posing like Steve did as he held both his shield and Mjiolnir when facing Thanos in <a href="Avengers Endgame.html"/>Avengers: Endgame</a>.</li>
      <li>Peter uses vehicles that are abandoned on the bridge to take more of the drones out until he finds Quentin, punching him and breaking his helmet, disabling all the drones and saving his friends from dying.</li>
      <li>Quentin orders EDITH to shoot Peter with the drones, in which the drones shoot at hime before Beck puts Peter in another illusion. Peter uses his "Peter tingle" to sense the drones instead of being able to see them because the illusion is fake and the drones are camoflauged in the environment. He takes them out by smashing them, using them against each other when they shoot at him, stabbing them wih broken parts, and later facing one of the drones to shoot at Quentin. Blood is shown, but it's not too graphic</li>
      <li>Peter reaches in the air to see someone shoot at him, in which it's the real Quentin and the other Quentin is an illusion from the drones with the real Quentin dying.</li>
      <li>The first end credits scene shows Quentin manipulating the footage take in London saying Peter caused the chaos in London and Mysterio's death and exposes Peter's true identity of being Spider-man to the world, which directly sets up <a href="Spider-Man No Way Home.html"/>Spider-Man: No Way Home</a>.</li>
      <li>In the second end credits scene, it's revealed that Nick Fury and Maria Hill are actually Talos and his wife, Soren in disguise which both were introduced in <a href="Captain Marvel.html"/>Captain Marvel</a>, while the real nick Fury is in space with SWORD, setting it up. SWORD is explored more in <a href="WandaVision Episode Menu.html"/>WandaVision</a> while the end credits scene sets up the Disney+ series, <a href="Secret Invasion Episode Menu.html"/>Secret Invasion</a>.</li>
